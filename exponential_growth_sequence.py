Assignment
Complete the exponential_growth function. Given the initial followers count n, growth factor factor, and number of days days, return a list containing the exponential growth of followers for each day.
For example:
- Initial followers: 10
- Growth factor: 2
- Days: 4
Growth sequence: [10, 20, 40, 80, 160]
Each day's value is the previous day's value multiplied by factor.
