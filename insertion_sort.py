Assignment
Our influencers want to sort their affiliate deals by revenue. None of our users have more than a couple hundred affiliate deals, so we don't need an n * log(n) algorithm like merge sort. In fact, insertion_sort can be faster than merge_sort, and uses less of our server's memory.
Complete the insertion_sort function according to the given pseudocode:

    For each index in the input list, starting with the second element:
        Set a j variable to the current index
        While j is greater than 0 and the element at index j-1 is greater than the element at index j:
            Swap the elements at indices j and j-1
            Decrement j by 1
    Return the list
