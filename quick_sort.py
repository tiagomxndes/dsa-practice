Assignment
We now have two sorting algorithms on our LockedIn backend! It is a bit annoying to maintain both in the codebase. Quicksort is fast on large datasets just like merge sort, but is also lighter on memory usage. Let's use quick sort for both follower count and influencer revenue sorting!
Complete the quick_sort and partition functions according to the given algorithms.
The process is started with quick_sort(A, 0, len(A)-1).

    Complete quick_sort(nums, low, high):
        If low is less than high:
            Partition the input list using the partition function and store the returned "middle" index
            Recursively call quick_sort on the elements left of the pivot (low to middle - 1)
            Recursively call quick_sort on the elements right of the pivot (middle + 1 to high)
    partition(nums, low, high):
        Set pivot to the element at index high
        Set i to the index before low
        For each index (j) in range(low, high):
            If the element at index j is less than the pivot:
                Increment i by 1
                Swap the element at index i with the element at index j
        Swap the element at index i + 1 with the element at index high (the pivot's position)
        Return i + 1 (the pivot's new index)
